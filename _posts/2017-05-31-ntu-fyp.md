3D printing is a flexible manufacturing method that is suitable for producing the complicated components of UAVs. However, compared to components produced by traditional method, 3D printed components are lacking in term of strength, and therefore, reliability. The project explored two different reinforcement methods: Carbon fiber reinforced polimer (CFRP) reinforcement, and fill compositing. Samples were produced and tested with various methods such as three-point bending and a custom L-shaped bending setup. Both reinforcement methods was shown to create significant increase in strength of the printed parts. Moreover, topology optimization was carried out realize the optimal design for the L-shaped sample under specific load.

More details regarding the project can be found in this [report](/assets/doc/Thesis_NTU.pdf).
