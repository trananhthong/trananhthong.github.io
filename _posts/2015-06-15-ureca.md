As 3D printing has been improved over recent years, the technology are considered for a wider range of applications including the manufacturing of aerospace alloy components which are traditionally manufactured by casting. This project aimed to evaluate the properties of IN100 alloy produced by Laser aided additive manufacturing and casting. My tasks in this project included: 
* Preparing and polishing the material samples
* Producing images using optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
* Measuring the Vickers hardness of the samples

The project was done under the Undergraduate Research Experience on CAmpus (URECA) program of NTU. More details of the experiment setup and results can be found in the [project report](/assets/doc/URECA.pdf).
