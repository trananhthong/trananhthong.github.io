The project explored methods of likelihood-free inference and prediction for systems where the underlying dynamics are unknown. The proposed method uses multi-task Bayesian Optimization for inference and Bayesian Linear Auto-Regression for prediction of the underlying parameters. The method was experimented with several toy simulators and two models from human behavioral research. The method was implemented by augmenting the [ELFI](https://github.com/elfi-dev/elfi) library with multi-task Gaussian Process and Bayesian optimization from `GPyTorch` and `BoTorch`.
