In recent years, events such as the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March 2023 have highlighted the need for developing a deeper understanding of the deposit base. The objective of this study is to improve the prediction quality of deposit product migration through customer segmentation us... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>COVID-19 Impact on Credit Loss Modelling</title><link href="/projects/seb-credit-risk/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="COVID-19 Impact on Credit Loss Modelling" /><published>2021-06-07T13:00:01+03:00</published> <updated>2021-07-26T11:04:01+03:00</updated> <id>/projects/seb-credit-risk/</id> <content src="/projects/seb-credit-risk/" /> <author> <name>Thong Tran</name> </author> <category term="Project" /> <category term="Aalto" /> <summary> Background The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures from governments to alleviate its effects has created complicated economic conditions. As a result, conventional models such as the single-factor Merton-Vasicek (MV) model for estimating credit risk have failed to reliably predict the probability of default (PD) in the recent years. The project aimed to provide a more robust method for PD predi... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Likelihood-free Inference for State-Space Models</title><link href="/projects/pml/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Likelihood-free Inference for State-Space Models" /><published>2021-05-31T13:00:01+03:00</published> <updated>2021-07-26T11:04:01+03:00</updated> <id>/projects/pml/</id> <content src="/projects/pml/" /> <author> <name>Thong Tran</name> </author> <category term="Project" /> <category term="Aalto" /> <summary> The project explored methods of likelihood-free inference and prediction for systems where the underlying dynamics are unknown. The proposed method uses multi-task Bayesian Optimization for inference and Bayesian Linear Auto-Regression for prediction of the underlying parameters. The method was experimented with several toy simulators and two models from human behavioral research. The experimen... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>A Study on Approximate Bayesian Computation</title><link href="/projects/aalto-bachelor-thesis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Study on Approximate Bayesian Computation" /><published>2020-04-17T13:00:01+03:00</published> <updated>2021-07-26T11:04:01+03:00</updated> <id>/projects/aalto-bachelor-thesis/</id> <content src="/projects/aalto-bachelor-thesis/" /> <author> <name>Thong Tran</name> </author> <category term="Project" /> <category term="Aalto" /> <summary> Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a framework for inference that utilize simulations to bypass the need to explicitly calculate likelihoods. The project investigated the effects of factors such as summary statistics, distance measures, and dimension reduction on the performance of ABC. This was done by calculating the Wasserstein distances between the approximate posteriors produced by ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Kodimpi - Relocation Recommendation Application</title><link href="/projects/kodimpi/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kodimpi - Relocation Recommendation Application" /><published>2019-12-05T12:00:01+02:00</published> <updated>2021-07-26T11:04:01+03:00</updated> <id>/projects/kodimpi/</id> <content src="/projects/kodimpi/" /> <author> <name>Thong Tran</name> </author> <category term="Project" /> <category term="Aalto" /> <summary> Background The group project was done for the pilot of the Data Science Project course of Aalto University’s School of Computer Science. The organization client, Reaktor, wanted to make use of the Paavo open postal code data. Paavo data spanned from 2012 to 2017 and included population structures, education levels, employment, income, and housing prices. As the data features were closely relat... </summary> </entry> </feed>
